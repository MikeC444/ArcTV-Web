# Web changes the Firestick app doesn't have yet

The Firestick app (`MikeC444/ArcTV-AndroidTV`) is kept level with this web app. Whenever a user-visible change lands here
and is NOT made on the Firestick in the same go, add it to **Pending on Firestick** below (what changed, when, why it
matters). When the Firestick gets it, **delete the line**: this list only ever holds what is still missing.

## Pending on Firestick

Nothing is missing from the Firestick's code. The three "Picked for you" changes (liked titles excluded, genre split + rotation, Remove from Picked for you; ArcTV-AndroidTV Post-Milestone-56) are on its `main` but not in a release yet (0.1.5 doesn't have them), so TVs get them with the next release.

## Firestick-only (not on web, on purpose)

Listed so a difference isn't mistaken for a missed port.

- The marketing site at arctv.org (`landing/`); the app itself is at web.arctv.org. A website has no TV equivalent.
- Full-screen "Finish payment on your phone" page with a QR code (the web app goes straight to Stripe's own page).
- The Home hero for the next launch is chosen and its pictures downloaded in the background, so the first slide is instant (release 0.1.4).
